Auto Instance Recommender

A Python tool that recommends AWS EC2 instance types based on CPU and memory requirements, and retrieves On-Demand pricing.
Supports CSV and Excel input, interactive prompts for missing parameters, and outputs results into a standardized ./output/ directory with timestamped filenames.

Features

Input formats: Accepts .csv and .xlsx/.xls

Interactive prompts: If no --in file is passed, you are prompted for a path (and Excel sheet name if needed)

Output management: Results are written to ./output/ with timestamped filenames (e.g. recommend_20250830-213045.csv)

EC2 recommendations: Matches requirements against current-generation, x86_64 instance families (balanced, compute, memory)

Diagnostics: Adds transparency columns (overprov_vcpu, overprov_mem_gib, fit_reason) to show why a type was chosen

Pricing: Fetches On-Demand hourly rates from the AWS Pricing API

Extensible: Architecture allows adding new checks and cost factors

Usage
Install dependencies

pip install boto3 pandas openpyxl python-dotenv

Recommend instances

python auto_instance_recommender.py recommend --region us-east-1 --in apps.csv

Or with Excel:

python auto_instance_recommender.py recommend --region us-east-1 --in apps.xlsx --sheet Sheet1

If you omit --in, you will be prompted interactively.

Price recommendations

python auto_instance_recommender.py price --region us-east-1 --in ./output/recommend_20250830-213045.csv

If --in is omitted, you‚Äôll be prompted for the file path.

Output

Recommendations: ./output/recommend_<timestamp>.csv
Includes requested resources, profile, chosen instance, overprovision metrics, and fit reason.

Pricing: ./output/price_<timestamp>.csv
Extends recommendations with hourly price and pricing notes.

Roadmap

Guardrails (already noted)

Add logic to flag extreme overprovisioning (e.g., >4√ó requested resources).

Suggest alternate strategies (e.g., splitting workload, different family).

Improve pricing input defaults

price should automatically look in the ./output folder for the most recent recommendation file if no --in is provided.

Still allow explicit input via --in.

Server metadata awareness

Include attributes like underlying OS by default.

Use OS to influence pricing (Linux vs Windows).

Additional cost dimensions
Recommend adding checks for:

Storage requirements (EBS size/IOPS, gp3 vs io1).

Network throughput (bandwidth tiers by instance family).

Licensing costs (SQL Server, RHEL, SUSE).

Dedicated tenancy pricing differences.

Spot instance pricing as an alternative.

Monthly cost output

Extend pricing step to compute monthly cost per server (e.g., hourly √ó 730).

Allow user to choose between hourly/monthly outputs.

Enhanced Excel integration

Auto-detect multiple sheets and process them in batch.

Retain formatting when writing results back to Excel.

Visualization & reporting

Generate charts (CPU vs memory vs price scatterplot).

Summarize costs by region or profile type.

Automation hooks

Add option to push outputs to S3 or Google Sheets.

Enable integration with migration tracking tools (e.g., ServiceNow export).

Example Workflow

1. Prepare an input CSV:
id,vcpu,memory_gib,profile
app-001,2,8,balanced
db-001,8,64,memory
etl-001,8,24,

2. Run recommender:
python auto_instance_recommender.py recommend --region us-east-1 --in apps.csv

3. Run pricer:
python auto_instance_recommender.py price --region us-east-1 --in ./output/recommend_20250830-213045.csv
